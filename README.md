# Applications-of-Threads-and-Semaphores

## Abstract
Through this project, we try to understand the various applications of threads and
semaphores. To study how these are used and to be able to use these methods
ourselves, we have studied some already existing problems related to threads and
semaphores. Then we have come up with 3 new problem statements and solved them
using the concepts mentioned above.
The problems which we chose to study are :
• Reader/Writer Problem
• Dining Philosopher Problem
• Producer-Consumer Problem
• Doctor-Patient Problem
• Cigarette-Smokers Problem
• Sleeping Barber Problem
We have used C language to solve the problem statements.
